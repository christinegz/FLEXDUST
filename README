FLEXDUST
Author: Christine Groot Zwaaftink (cgz@nilu.no)

FLEXDUST can be used to calculate dust emission and prepare input (RELEASE) files for FLEXPART. 
Other than input files in this folder, ECMWF wind fields are necessary. See FLEXPART documentation for details. The source code for reading of wind fields was mostly copied from FLEXPART.
FLEXDUST requires the same libraries installed as FLEXPART.

The model has only been tested for a single nested wind field and a single nested land cover file. Additional nested fields will require adjustments.

Settings (e.g. domain, resolution, input files) can be adjusted in dust_mod.f90.

To run the model:
-prepare ECMWF data
-adjust paths in dust_mod.f90
-compile the code (make -f Makefile)
-run with ./FLEXDUST
